# MNIST-Digit-Classification
The "Hello World" project of ANNs and computer vision. The project uses MNIST image data to build a multiclassifier model that identies hand written digits. I created a CNN where the final output layer uses Softmax activation in order to reflect the model's confidence in prediction. The evaluation is visualized through a series of figures and a confusion matrix.
